# Feedback

### **Strengths**
1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - The code implements core features like login, registration, and password change.
   - It uses file handling to persist user data, which is a good starting point for user management.

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Functions like `login`, `register`, `menu`, and `passwordchange` are well-separated, making the code easier to follow.

3. **User Feedback**:
   - The program provides clear prompts and feedback to the user, improving usability.

### **Issues and Suggestions for Improvement**

#### 1. **Insecure Password Storage**
   - Passwords are stored in plaintext in `plain_text.txt`, which is a major security risk.
   - **Fix**: Use a library like `bcrypt` to hash passwords before storing them and verify the hash during login.

   Example:
   ```python
   import bcrypt

   # Hashing a password
   hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())

   # Verifying a password
   if bcrypt.checkpw(input_password.encode(), hashed_password):
       print("Login successful!")
   ```

#### 2. **File Handling Issues**
   - The `passwordchange` function appends a new entry to the file instead of updating the existing password, leading to duplicate entries.
   - **Fix**: Read the file into memory, update the relevant entry, and rewrite the file.

   Example:
   ```python
   def passwordchange():
       nuser = input('Username? ')
       npass = input('New password? ')
       if len(npass) < 4:
           print('Password must be minimum 4 characters')
           return
       updated = False
       with open('plain_text.txt', 'r') as file:
           lines = file.readlines()
       with open('plain_text.txt', 'w') as file:
           for line in lines:
               user, _ = line.strip().split(',')
               if user == nuser:
                   file.write(f'{nuser},{npass}\n')
                   updated = True
               else:
                   file.write(line)
       if updated:
           print('Password changed successfully')
       else:
           print('Username not found')
   ```

---

#### 3. **Logic Issues**
   - **`login` Function**:
     - The `else` block inside the `for` loop is misplaced. It will always execute if the last login attempt fails, even if a previous attempt succeeded.
     - **Fix**: Move the `else` block outside the loop.

   - **`main` Function**:
     - The `quit` statement is not called correctly. It should be `quit()`.

---

#### 4. **Global State Management**
   - The `logins` list is populated at the start of the program but is not updated when new users are registered or passwords are changed.
   - **Fix**: Reload the `logins` list from the file after any modification.

---

#### 5. **Error Handling**
   - The program does not handle file-related errors, such as missing `plain_text.txt`.
   - **Fix**: Add proper error handling using `try-except` blocks.

   Example:
   ```python
   try:
       with open('plain_text.txt', 'r') as file:
           # File operations
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print('Error: User data file not found.')
   ```

---

#### 6. **Code Readability**
   - The code lacks comments explaining the purpose of each function and key logic.
   - **Fix**: Add comments to improve readability and maintainability.

---

#### 7. **Password Validation**
   - The program only checks for a minimum password length but does not enforce other security measures (e.g., complexity).
   - **Fix**: Add more robust password validation rules.
