Here is feedback on the provided code:

---

### **Strengths**
1. **Basic Structure**:
   - The code has a clear structure with functions for different tasks (`Main`, `Login_account`, `Register_account`, `Change_Password`, etc.).
   - It uses input prompts to interact with the user.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Different functionalities (e.g., login, registration, password change) are separated into their own functions, which is a good practice.

---

### **Issues and Suggestions for Improvement**

#### 1. **Hardcoded Usernames and Passwords**
   - The `Name` and `Password` lists are hardcoded in multiple functions (`Main` and `Login_account`), which is not scalable or secure.
   - **Fix**: Store usernames and hashed passwords in a file or database. Use libraries like `bcrypt` to hash and verify passwords.

---

#### 2. **Password Security**
   - The code does not verify passwords securely. It simply compares plaintext inputs with hardcoded hashed passwords.
   - **Fix**: Use a library like `bcrypt` to hash new passwords and verify them during login.

   Example:
   ```python
   import bcrypt

   salt = b"$2b$12$ieYNkQp8QumgedUo30nuPO"

   # Hashing a password
   hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt=salt)

   # Verifying a password
   if bcrypt.checkpw(input_password.encode(), hashed_password):
       print("Login successful!")
   ```

---

#### 3. **Incomplete Logic**
   - The `Login_account` function does not actually check if the entered username and password match any stored credentials.
   - The `In_domain` function does not verify if the user is logged in before allowing password changes.
   - **Fix**: Implement proper logic to validate user credentials and ensure only logged-in users can change passwords.

---

#### 4. **File Handling Issues**
   - The `Register_account` function overwrites the `source.csv` file every time a new user registers, erasing previous data.
   - **Fix**: Open the file in append mode (`"a"`) instead of write mode (`"w"`) to preserve existing data.

   ```python
   with open("source.csv", "a") as file:
       file.write(f"{Name_New},{Password_New}\n")
   ```

---

#### 5. **Unused Variables**
   - Variables like `Name_Old` and `Password_Old` in `Login_account` are defined but not used meaningfully.
   - **Fix**: Use these variables to validate the user's login credentials.

---

#### 6. **Empty `End_Program` Function**
   - The `End_Program` function is defined but does nothing.
   - **Fix**: Add functionality to gracefully exit the program.

   ```python
   def End_Program():
       print("Goodbye!")
       exit()
   ```

---

#### 7. **Code Readability**
   - The code lacks comments and proper formatting, making it harder to understand.
   - **Fix**: Add comments explaining the purpose of each function and improve formatting.
